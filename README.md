## About Me:
- üî≠ I'm a rising sophomore at UMass Amherst majoring in Computer Science, minoring in Business and pursuing a Letter of Specialization in Creative Writing. I'm delving into research with the Early Research Scholars Program (ERSP).
- üå± I‚Äôm currently learning React.js and Tailwind CSS. 
- ü§ù I‚Äôm looking to collaborate on open-source projects that have potential real-life implications and can be used for societal good.
- üÜò I have a keen interest in roles in Fintech and Product, at the junction of tech and business. That being said, I'm actively seeking volunteer/internship opportunities and dedicated to adding value to the organization, irrespective of the role.
- ‚ö° Fun fact: My analytical side is complemented by my creative edge- I'm a published author. Bringing together linguistics and tech is my niche.
- üí¨ Feel free to ask me about my experience as Undergraduate Course Assistant and IT Intern, running a student-led tech club, or publishing a book for that matter!
