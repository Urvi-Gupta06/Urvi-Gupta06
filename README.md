## About Me:
- 🔭 I'm currently delving into research in NLP. In the past, I've developed a database management project as a volunteer programmer at a local NGO. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Java and Object-Oriented Programming. 
- 🤝 I’m looking to collaborate on open-source projects that have potential real-life implications and can be used for societal good.
- 🆘 I'm seeking help in exploring research opportunities in NLP and other domains of ML.
- ⚡ Fun fact: My analytical side is complemented by my creative edge- I'm a CS student and a published author. Bringing together linguistics and tech is my niche.
- 💬 Feel free to ask me about my experience as an IT Intern, running a student-led tech club, or publishing a book that matter!
